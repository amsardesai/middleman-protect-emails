**middleman-protect-emails** is a [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) extension that encrypts email links on your page on the server-side and decodes them on the client-side, avoiding spam bots with no visible impacts to your users.

This gem makes use of the [ROT13](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) encryption algorithm to encrypt email links. Users must have Javascript enabled on their computers for the decoding stage to work.

## Installation

Add this line to your Middleman application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'middleman-protect-emails'
```

And then run:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Using this gem is as simple as adding the following line to your project's `config.rb` file:

```ruby
activate :protect_emails
```

And that's it! This will now protect all `mailto` links in your Middleman project.

### How it Works

If the middleware detects a `mailto` link on your page, it will automatically replace the link with an encrypted hash and insert a small script at the end of the page for the browser to decode it on page load. For example, if the following code was on one of your pages:

```html
<a href='mailto:hello@example.com'>Link</a>
```

It would automatically be replaced with:

```html
<a href='#email-protection-uryyb@rknzcyr.pbz'>Link</a>
```

This extension also encrypts link parameters (ex. `mailto:hello@example.com?subject=Some%20Subject`).
